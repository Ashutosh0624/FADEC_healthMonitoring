# 🛠️ FADEC Health Monitoring System (Avionics RTOS Project)

This project simulates an **RTOS-style sensor scheduler** for **avionics health monitoring**, inspired by the **FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control)** system used in jet engines like the **Rolls-Royce Trent 900**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- 🧠 Real-time polling of critical engine sensors
- 🏗️ Lightweight cooperative task scheduling (RTOS-style)
- 🛑 Fault detection logic via sensor health checks
- 📋 Centralized **BITE (Built-In Test Equipment)** logging
- 🔁 Expandable for additional sensors and FADEC behavior

---

## 🔧 System Architecture

- **Sensors Implemented:**
  - ✅ EGT Sensor (Exhaust Gas Temperature)
  - ✅ Altimeter (Altitude)
  - ✅ RPM Sensor (Fan Shaft Speed)
  - ✅ Bleed Valve Position Sensor

- **Core Modules:**
  | Module | Responsibility |
  |--------|----------------|
  | `SensorTypes.h` | Defines sensor structures and their `read()` / `status()` functions |
  | `SensorInterface.h` | Generic interface using function pointers |
  | `TaskScheduler.h` | Defines `SensorTask` for periodic execution |
  | `BITELogger.h` | Singleton logger for centralized fault tracking |
  | `main.cpp` | RTOS-style loop for sensor execution, fault detection, and logging |

---

## 📦 Design Patterns Used

- ✅ **Singleton Pattern** for `BITELogger`
- ✅ **Interface Abstraction** via function pointers (C-style polymorphism)
- ✅ **RTOS Simulation** using cooperative polling and timestamps

---

## ⚠️ Fault Detection Logic (Example)

- EGT over 950°C triggers a **“FAULT: EGT Overtemperature”** log
- Similar logic can be extended for:
  - Bleed Valve mismatch
  - Altitude stagnation
  - RPM overspeed

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates real-world concepts of:

- Embedded C++ sensor polling
- Avionics health monitoring (aligned with DO-178C philosophy)
- Fault injection and detection
- Logging and diagnostics (BITE-style)
- Modular and testable RTOS-like architecture
